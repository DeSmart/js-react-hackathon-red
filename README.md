# Recruitment Hackathon

## Rules
### We speak English only
Like it or not, we are a company on a global market. The majority of our clients is able to communicate with us only in English, so it has to be our strong asset. Therefore, **the whole challenge will be in English** - it will be the only allowed language.

### What do we value?
- teamwork
- open and clear communication
- ability to find solutions
- ability to understand requirements and ask questions leading to refinement of requirements
- being open to try and learn things out of comfort zone
- maturity in both approach to cooperation and evaluation of own capabilities
- self-awareness leading to asking questions when you find yourself stuck
- being humble in face of own lack of knowledge and experience

### What will be your challenge
There are going to be **five closed tasks** - a set of JS [katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)), where you will have to write code that passes given tests, which you will have to solve individually in 2 hours.

There is also going to be **one open task**, a small React app that you will have to develop in 5 hours (in a team of two or three).

### Evaluation
We value working software. But we also value the path leading to working software, and expect it to be enjoyable. You will be assigned a Product Owner, who also is going to be an observer.

The Product Owner will be a person you may ask questions about expectations from the result of the open challenge. But he will be also observing how you work.

### Pair programming
You will be working in pairs. 
Choose who's gonna be the _driver_, the other person will be the _navigator_. Switch roles each 15-30 minutes, i.e. after each completed task.

Discuss the task at hand first and agree on a solution.

### Unit tests
Writing unit tests for the code you create is a good practice. We would love to see them in your solution.
